##Your Challenge
1. Change the title of your web app in the `head` of your HTML structure to _Eagle Justice League_
>
2. Within the `body` of your HTML structure, create the following:
  + A **header** that contains the name of your team
  + A **paragraph** with your team's mission statement
  + An **ordered list** with the names of all your team members
  + Within each ordered list item, create a **paragraph** that details each team member's super power.
  + A **picture** of your team


_Note: Remember to make a commit after each html element is added!_
