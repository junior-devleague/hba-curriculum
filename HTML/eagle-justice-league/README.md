#Eagle Justice League
We will be practicing how to structure HTML to create an informative web application about the Eagle Justice Team!


##Objective
To create a simple web application using **HTML elements** and style with CSS.


##Part 1 - HTML
>
##Set up
1. Clone this repository using the command line
2. Create a new file called `index.html`
>
##Your Challenge
1. Change the title of your web app in the `head` of your HTML structure to _Eagle Justice League_
>
2. Within the `body` of your HTML structure, create the following:
  + A **header** that contains the name of your team
  + A **paragraph** with your team's mission statement
  + An **ordered list** with the names of all your team members
  + Within each ordered list item, create a **paragraph** that details each team member's super power.
  + A **picture** of your team


_Note: Remember to make a commit after each html element is added!_

##Part 2 - CSS
>
##Set up
1. Create a new file called `styles.css`
2. Link your CSS file in your HTML
>

##Your Challenge

1. Within the `body` element, change the following:
  + The _value_ of the _property_ `background-color` to a color of your choice

_Note: Each element must have a different `background-color` from one another._

2. For each `p` element within the `body` element, change the following:
  + The _value_ of the _property_ `font-size` to `10px`

3. For each `li` element with the `body` element, change the following:
  + The _value_ of the _property_ `border-style` to `solid`

_Bonus: Modify the values of 5 different elemenet properties and make your picture a 300px by 300px size._
